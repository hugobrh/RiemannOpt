Repo for [Through-The-Wall Radar Imaging With Wall Clutter Removal Via Riemannian Optimization On The Fixed-Rank Manifold
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10445908)

You may create a conda env with `riemannopt_env.yml` which includes PyManopt.

Then, the custom complex manifolds in this repo have to be added to the `manifolds` folder of your PyManopt

The main code is then in `huber_bcd.py` (right now the sample data file for the example has to be uploaded still)
